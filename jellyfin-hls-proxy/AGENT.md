instructions:

- code will be developed in the Rust programming language
- this directory is part of a workspace with 2 other crates
- those crates can be used (and probably will be used), but there can be made NO changes outside of this directory
- you are allowed to go out and research, especially about the jellyfin api
- we are looking for maximum compatibility with all jellyfin clients, built-in and external

- before the start of every milestone, create a branch off of the main branch aolled milestone-<name>
- we only _ever_ add files into commits that are part of this directory and children. for example: git add .
- after every milestone, if the user accepts it, check the changes into git.
- using a clear but terse and to the point git commit message
- then ask the user to git merge the changes into the main branch
